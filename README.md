# LaminarStateEstimator-CT

## Overview
This code repository contains the data analysis and algorithm demonstrations associated with the paper titled *A Framework of State Estimation on the Laminar Grinding based on the CT Image-Force Model*. The code is written in MATLAB and requires the loading of an open-source project, "MNI2FS (MNI2FS: 364 High-resolution surface rendering of MNI registered volumes)," to function properly.

If you use any of the methods presented in this project, whether they are algorithms or workflows, in your work, please acknowledge this project as a reference in your publications.

The code within this repository will continue to be maintained for an additional year, with particular attention given to the explanation of code usage, which will be completed within one month. Should you encounter any issues with the algorithms in this repository, please feel free to contact me via email at jihao.liu@sjtu.edu.cn, by the subject line *[Code: Sensors_LaminarStateEstimator-CT]*.

The dataset *Verse: Large Scale Vertebrae Segmentation Challenge* is one of the important source in our project. For runing our codes, pleased prepare and download the cases of CT images from the [github](https://github.com/anjany/verse)
